## üß† About the Workshop

The Neuromorphic Computing for Development and Learning Workshop is a full-day event uniting experts from academia and industry to explore advances in neuromorphic computing and developmental learning. The workshop focuses on brain-inspired sensing and computing, particularly spiking neural networks (SNNs), which enable efficient, adaptive, real-time processing. Topics include event-driven sensing, visual navigation, spike-based and contrastive learning, and neuromorphic architectures, highlighting their role in sensorimotor and cognitive development. Keynotes, poster sessions, and industry demos will showcase applications in robotics and sensory technologies, emphasizing perception, attention, and decision-making. Hands-on tutorials will offer practical experience in selective attention, perception, and embodied learning. The day concludes with a synthesis of insights and future research directions.

## üìñ Content

Traditional AI struggles with real-time adaptability, continual learning, and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic computing addresses these challenges through event-driven architectures and spiking neural networks (SNNs), enabling low-power, real-time processing ideal for robotics and smart sensors. By mimicking biological systems, neuromorphic models process only relevant environmental changes, reducing data load and supporting adaptive, context-aware behavior. SNNs add mechanisms like synaptic plasticity and temporal coding for experience-driven learning. Aligned with the goals of the International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL), this workshop explores how neuromorphic principles support lifelong, embodied learning in autonomous agents. Topics include contrastive learning, continual adaptation, and the role of embodiment in cognitive systems. The program features both theoretical discussions and hands-on sessions on neuromorphic perception, navigation, and sensorimotor integration, fostering collaboration across neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and AI.
