<h2>I. Duration: Full Day Workshop</h2>
<p>
The Neuromorphic Computing for Development and Learning Workshop is a full-day event focused on advancements in neuromorphic computing and developmental learning. 
It brings together experts, researchers, and industry professionals to explore neuromorphic sensing, computing with spiking neural networks (SNNs), and their role in developmental learning.
Keynote talks and tutorials will cover event-driven sensing, visual navigation, contrastive learning, spike-based learning, and neuromorphic architectures.
The event will include networking sessions, industry demonstrations, and hands-on tutorials on selective attention, perception, and embodied learning.
</p>

<h2>II. Content of the Workshop</h2>
<p>
Neuromorphic computing offers real-time, low-power solutions through event-driven architectures and SNNs, addressing continual learning and sensory-motor integration challenges.
This workshop will explore experience-driven evolution, synaptic plasticity, local adaptation, and temporal coding.
Topics link neuromorphic principles to developmental learning concepts such as self-organization, incremental learning, contrastive learning, and the embodiment of cognition.
Hands-on sessions will demonstrate applications like selective attention, navigation with neuromorphic vision, and closed-loop sensorimotor learning.
